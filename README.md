#  ___OPTION 2:___
### Test hyperparameters with gridsearchCV and tfidf vectorizer:

***A good way to automate the test phase and save time searching for the best parameters to***
***generate the most accurate model possible is to use GrisearchCV made available by scikit-learn***
***The code in ModelsGenerator.py must be customized based on the dataset to be analyzed***
### ***WARNING !! ***
### ***beware if we don't study the scikit-learn documentation we could start infinite analyzes***
### ***so it is always advisable to know what we are doing ***
